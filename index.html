            <p>
                Uhmm there is a lot actually that I would like to say... I will start with Merry Christmas my love! This would be our first Christmas together and I am so excited to spend it with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This time last year, I had promised myself that 2025 would be my year. I had given up on trying to chase anyone and I just wanted to focus on myself and my career. And tbh I said that I will focus on trading and on finding more ways to make money, and I thought that it's the only thing that mattered but I was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year, 2025, I was very successful. I didn't make money, I didn't improve my career as such, but I got the girl that I love, the girl I had always wanted, the girl I chased for two years, the girl that makes me the happiest, the girl with the most beautiful eyes in the world. I got you! Even though sometimes it might seem to  you that I stopped trying, I promise you that I didn't and I would never stop. I want to build a great life for us in the future and I won't stop trying. I am giving you my word sade, I will do everything in my power to make your dreams come true.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for 9 months of happiness, fun, support, emotion, and love. You've become the safest place in my world, and I can't wait to spend every day, every month, every year, and every Christmas with you!
            </p>
            <p>I love you endlessly...</p>
